These are some hacky examples of rendering D3 charts with different technologies:
* *svg.html*: SVG (standard D3)
   * No ie8 or ie7 compatibility.  
   * Full transition support.
* *canvas.html*: Canvas rendering
   * No ie8 or ie7 compatibility: Attempted compatibility with webshims (failed).  
   * Full transition support.
* *index.html*: RaphaelJS
   * Full browser compatibility.  
   * Minimal transition support (in progress).
* *r2d3.html*: [r2d3.js](https://github.com/mhemesath/r2d3): a raphael-d3 library
   * Full browser compatibility
   * Transition support

The purpose is to explore and compare techniques for rendering D3 charts with full browser compatibility.

Be warned, many hacks and abandoned experiments within.
